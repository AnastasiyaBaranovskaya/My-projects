++Hello, my name is Nastya and I would like to tell you about material UI.[slide]

You might know that Material UI is based on UI framework that uses Google Material Design principles and provides a bunch of different isolated and independent components of react elements. They can be used as building blocks for building more complex user interface so the UI components themselves contain all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript built into them. The cool thing about those components is that they can actually be used without any dependendencies on external libraries like normalize the SS or JQuery or anything like that.[slide]

It kick-started in 2014, not long after React came out to the public, and has grown in popularity ever since. With over 46,000 stars on GitHub, Material-UI is one of the top user interface libraries for React out there.

Let’s have a look at how to use material UI together with your react web application from scratch. You can learn everything from start to finish substitute so let’s first take a look at the Material UI website which can be found at material-ui comm and you can see it. 
[slide]Here on this website you can find all the information you need. 

To get started you can simply click on the “get started” link [slide] here and it guides you through the process of setting up you react application with that library installed and then you can find all the information here about the material design components and how to use those components[slide]. You can see there was the only components that are present in the libraries.

After installation open your code in code editor which you prefer. Choose the App.js file and get rid of the default output of the react application. Delete  everything which is inside in the return statement in app component and place of the JSX code which is needed to produce the output application. You can delete the import from logo as well.[slide]

After that you can start over and insert our own code. First you must create a new subfolder in the SRC folder, and create a new file inside where you place your Material UI component. 
On the Material UI website in the left menu on the  Components Demos tab, select the component that you need. For each component you will find several demo over. You can use any of the components as shown in the documentation. [slide]

If you click on the source icon you are gonna be able to see the actual source of this component. You may copy this to you file. 
When you insert the code do not forget to connect your file in App.js.To change the style of the component you selected, find it in the "API Component" tab. Here you can learn more about the properties and the CSS customization points.[slide]

Using MATERIAL UI will allow you to make your projects much easier and faster. Therefore, I believe that you should get acquainted with this framework closer)[slide]

Thanks for attention)
